def convert(number: int) -> str:
    """
    Convert a number into a sound representation based on its divisibility.

    This function checks if the provided number is divisible by 3, 5, or 7
    and returns a concatenated string of sounds: "Pling" for 3, "Plang" for 5,
    and "Plong" for 7. If the number is not divisible by any of these,
    the function returns the number as a string.

    Args:
        number: The number to convert.
    Returns:
        A sound representation of the number or the number itself as a string.

    # Append sounds to the output based on the number divisibility
    output = [sound for divisor, sound in sound_map.items() if number % divisor == 0]

    # Return joined output or number as string
    return "".join(output) if output else str(number)
